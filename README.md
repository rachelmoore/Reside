## Instructions to run on your local machine:

1. Create a new folder on your computer. Clonet the repository into this folder: `git clone https://github.com/rachelmoore/Reside.git`
2. Change directories into `reside-test` which should now be inside the folder you used to make the clone. 
3. Open a new terminal window and again navigate to the `reside-test` directory. Once there, run `npm start`. 
4. Open up a browser window and type http://localhost:3000/ in the address field. You should see 'Rex Real Estate' on the screen!
