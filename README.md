## Instructions to run on your local machine:

1. Create a new folder on your computer. Clone the repository into this folder: `git clone https://github.com/rachelmoore/RexRealEstate.git`
2. Change directories into `Reside` which should now be inside the folder you used to make the clone. 
3. Change directories into `reside-test`. 
4. Once inside `reside-test`, run `npm install`. This will take a minute. 
5. After that runs, run `npm start`.  
4. A browser window with http://localhost:3000/ in the address field should open. If no window automatically opens, open a browser tab and type in http://localhost:3000/. You should see 'Rex Real Estate' on the screen!
